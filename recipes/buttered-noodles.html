<h2>Buttered Noodles</h2>
<p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <li>1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine noodles</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces</li>

</ul>
